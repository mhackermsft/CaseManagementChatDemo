Case Management Chat Demo

.NET Aspire solution featuring a Blazor UI and API layer.
Simple demonstration on how Azure OpenAI and Semantic Kernel could be used to build a solution to chat over case files.

This demonstration uses hardcoded case details and sample case file documents in PDF format.
The API layer could easily be updated to request case details and document locations from remote systems or databases.
All document vectors are stored in memory. For a more robust solution or to work with larger documents you could modify the code to utilize a vector database.

This is for demonstration purpsoes only and is not a supported solution.
